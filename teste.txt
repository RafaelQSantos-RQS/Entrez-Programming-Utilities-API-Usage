BACKGROUND: There exists a lacuna in the structured reporting of swallowing 
dysfunction and quality of life (QoL) outcome following major glossectomy.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study to assess the swallowing dysfunction and QoL 
following STG (subtotal glossectomy) or NTG (near total glossectomy) over a 
6-month period using FEES and PAS scale, MDADI, and FACT-HN.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were available for analysis. The pre- and 
post-adjuvant evaluation revealed a statistically significant improvement in the 
composite MDADI and FACT-HN scores. Subscale analysis of FACT-HN scores revealed 
maximum deficit in the head and neck cancer-specific score domain followed by 
functional domain and social well-being domain, with serial improvement noted in 
the post-adjuvant setting.
CONCLUSION: This study showed serial improvement in terms of swallowing 
dysfunction although social and functional well-being domains related to QoL 
continued to reveal major deficits. Better outcomes were seen with preservation 
of bilateral base of tongue and mandible.
